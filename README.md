# my_vimrc

All the plugins are managed by [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim). So, first of all, you should do this:

    git clone https:github.comVundleVimVundle.vim.git ~.vimbundleVundle.vim

Next step, execute `:PluginInstall` while open this `.vimrc'. Some plugins are really HUGE, so this step may take a while.

All done!
